The link of the web site that has been deployed to the Heroku:
https://quiet-sands-71880.herokuapp.com/

# Project Capabilities
- Any type of user can access the website and "add to cart" any items/products existing in the product catalog
- Any type of user can be: authenticated user, non-authenticated user (aka guest user)
- Any item that was selected by authenticated user will be stored directly in the data-base
- An optimized cookie management system, which means that the selected items of an unauthenticated user (also known as a guest user) will be stored in the device's web browser memory (cookies). After navigating to the Shipping Information page, the user's cookies will be converted to Java Script objects, then to Python objects, and ultimately stored in the database according to the user supplied username and email address.
